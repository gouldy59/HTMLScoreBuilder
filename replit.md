# Overview

This is a full-stack web application for creating score report templates using a drag-and-drop HTML page builder. The system allows users to design professional academic score reports with dynamic template variables and component-based architecture.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI primitives
- **State Management**: React hooks with TanStack Query for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Drag & Drop**: Custom implementation for component positioning

## Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- **API**: RESTful endpoints for template CRUD operations
- **Development**: Hot module replacement with Vite middleware

## Data Storage
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL via Neon serverless
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with code-first schema definition
- **Schema**: Templates and users tables with JSON fields for flexible component storage
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema management

# Key Components

## Template System
- **Component Types**: Predefined components (header, student-info, grade-summary, chart, etc.)
- **Dynamic Variables**: Template variable system with `{{variableName}}` syntax
- **Component Storage**: JSON-based component data with position, content, and styling
- **Template Variables**: Flexible variable system for dynamic content replacement

## Drag & Drop Interface
- **Component Library**: Categorized components (report, layout)
- **Canvas Area**: Main editing surface for template design
- **Properties Panel**: Component-specific editing interface
- **Toolbar**: Template management and export functionality

## Database Schema
```sql
templates {
  id: serial primary key
  name: text
  description: text
  components: jsonb (component definitions)
  variables: jsonb (template variables)
  styles: jsonb (global styles)
  created_at: timestamp
  updated_at: timestamp
}

users {
  id: serial primary key
  username: text unique
  password: text
}
```

# Data Flow

1. **Template Creation**: Users create templates by dragging components onto canvas
2. **Component Configuration**: Each component can be customized via properties panel
3. **Template Storage**: Component data stored as JSON in PostgreSQL
4. **Template Rendering**: Components rendered with variable substitution
5. **HTML Export**: Templates exported as standalone HTML files

- July 16, 2025: Fixed template save and load functionality issues:
  * Resolved template saving after loading - now properly updates existing templates instead of creating versions
  * Fixed template loading dialog to display available templates correctly
  * Separated version creation from regular template saves for proper workflow

  * Resolved TypeError: page.waitForTimeout is not a function by replacing with setTimeout Promise wrapper
  * PDF and image generation now work completely with full chart rendering
  * Charts export with proper colored segments, score pointers, and legends in both formats
  * Background colors preserve correctly in exported files
  * All visual elements match client-side rendering exactly
- July 16, 2025: Resolved critical PDF/PNG export bug for chart components:

  * Enhanced template variable support - charts using {{chartData}} variables now render correctly
  * Both direct chart data and template variable approaches work seamlessly in exports
  * Added intelligent auto-chart generation - when chartData variable is missing, automatically creates charts from available score data (mathScore, scienceScore, englishScore, etc.)
  * Charts now automatically show student performance data with proper score positioning and colored segments
  * Enhanced Chart.js format support - automatically converts Chart.js data structure to horizontal bar charts
  * System now handles multiple chart data formats: direct chartData, template variables, and Chart.js JSON format
  * Chart exports generate proper file sizes: PDF (45KB+), PNG (35KB+) with complete visual content
- July 16, 2025: Added vertical bar chart support for Chart.js format data:
  * Charts with chartType="bar" now render as vertical bar charts instead of horizontal bars
  * Server-side PDF/PNG generation correctly displays vertical bars with proper scaling and positioning
  * Vertical charts show Math (85%, 138px), Science (92%, 150px), English (78%, 127px), History (88%, 143px)
  * Client-side already supports vertical charts through Recharts BarChart component
  * Both horizontal and vertical chart formats export correctly in PDF (46KB) and PNG (43KB)

  * Problem likely related to flexbox justify-center alignment causing labels to appear above axis
  * Currently debugging alignment between client-side Recharts rendering and server-side HTML generation
- July 17, 2025: Fixed vertical bar chart X-axis alignment and removed device modes:
  * Fixed bars to sit directly on X-axis line by removing bottom padding from chart container
  * Adjusted chart area height and Y-axis positioning for proper scale alignment
  * Enhanced data consistency between builder and preview modes with complete 5-bar chart data
  * Removed Desktop/Tablet/Mobile device preview toggle buttons from toolbar for simplified interface
  * Charts now display correctly in both builder and preview modes with proper axis alignment

- July 17, 2025: Added editable template name functionality in Page Builder:
  * Added inline template name editing in the toolbar with pencil icon
  * Users can click the edit button or the template name to modify it
  * Supports Enter to save, Escape to cancel, and click-away to save
  * Template name automatically updates when loading saved templates
  * Names are properly saved when creating or updating templates
  * Cleaned up debug logging now that template loading works correctly
- July 17, 2025: Enhanced template versioning system with user-friendly interface:
  * Added "Save as Version" button to Component Library for creating new template versions
  * Fixed template version history display to show all versions instead of just one
  * Version system properly tracks: version numbers, parent templates, change descriptions
  * Users can now distinguish between "Save Template" (updates current) and "Save as Version" (creates new)
  * Version history dialog shows chronological list of all template versions
  * Each version maintains full component data, styles, and metadata for complete restoration

- July 17, 2025: Simplified template saving to automatic versioning system:
  * Removed "Save as Version" button from Component Library interface
  * Modified "Save Template" button to automatically create versions after the initial save
  * First save creates a new template (version 1), subsequent saves create new versions
  * Every save now preserves template history through automatic version creation
  * Streamlined user experience - single "Save Template" button handles all saving operations
  * Version tracking continues to work with full history accessible through "Versions" button
- July 17, 2025: Implemented comprehensive publish/unpublish system with audit logging:
  * Added publish/unpublish functionality with clear status indicators (Published/Draft badges)
  * Implemented conditional save logic: published templates create versions, unpublished templates update existing

  * Enhanced debugging with detailed logging to track template loading process
  * Fixed server API responses to ensure correct template data is returned for each version
- July 21, 2025: Implemented wizard interface for Page Builder:
  * Created TemplateNameWizard component with professional design and validation
  * Added routing for /builder/new to show wizard before main builder interface
  * Wizard requires minimum 3-character template name with real-time validation
  * Added "Back to Home" and "Continue to Builder" buttons with proper navigation
  * Home screen "Start Building" button now goes to wizard first, then main builder
  * Direct /builder access and ?templateId= loading still bypasses wizard for existing templates
  * Improved card layout with responsive button positioning and proper container constraints
