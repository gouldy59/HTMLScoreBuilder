# Overview

This is a full-stack web application for creating score report templates using a drag-and-drop HTML page builder. The system allows users to design professional academic score reports with dynamic template variables and component-based architecture.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI primitives
- **State Management**: React hooks with TanStack Query for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Drag & Drop**: Custom implementation for component positioning

## Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- **API**: RESTful endpoints for template CRUD operations
- **Development**: Hot module replacement with Vite middleware

## Data Storage
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL via Neon serverless (live and persistent)
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with code-first schema definition
- **Schema**: Templates, users, and audit log tables with JSON fields for flexible component storage
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema management and database operations
- **Storage Implementation**: DatabaseStorage class with full CRUD operations and versioning support

# Key Components

## Template System
- **Component Types**: Predefined components (header, student-info, grade-summary, chart, etc.)
- **Dynamic Variables**: Template variable system with `{{variableName}}` syntax
- **Component Storage**: JSON-based component data with position, content, and styling
- **Template Variables**: Flexible variable system for dynamic content replacement

## Drag & Drop Interface
- **Component Library**: Categorized components (report, layout)
- **Canvas Area**: Main editing surface for template design
- **Properties Panel**: Component-specific editing interface
- **Toolbar**: Template management and export functionality

## Database Schema
```sql
templates {
  id: serial primary key
  name: text
  description: text
  components: jsonb (component definitions)
  variables: jsonb (template variables)
  styles: jsonb (global styles)
  created_at: timestamp
  updated_at: timestamp
}

users {
  id: serial primary key
  username: text unique
  password: text
}
```

# Data Flow

1. **Template Creation**: Users create templates by dragging components onto canvas
2. **Component Configuration**: Each component can be customized via properties panel
3. **Template Storage**: Component data stored as JSON in PostgreSQL
4. **Template Rendering**: Components rendered with variable substitution
5. **HTML Export**: Templates exported as standalone HTML files
